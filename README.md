# tw-research

This is a Chrome Extension to link colleagues and references in several publication websites, including [Scopus](https://www.scopus.com/), [Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.com/), and [ResearchGate](https://www.researchgate.net/), to a [Node.js](https://tiddlywiki.com/static/Installing%2520TiddlyWiki%2520on%2520Node.js.html)-based [TiddlyWiki](https://tiddlywiki.com/).

## Motivation

I have been using [Zotero](https://www.zotero.org/) and [Refnotes](https://kookma.github.io/TW-Refnotes/) in [TiddlyWiki](https://tiddlywiki.com/) to manage my references. When I search and read new literature online, it is not always easy to:

- Remember which literature already exists in [Zotero](https://www.zotero.org/) and [TiddlyWiki](https://tiddlywiki.com/).
- Search the same literature across platforms (e.g., [Scopus](https://www.scopus.com/), [Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.com/)).
- Link back to [TiddlyWiki](https://tiddlywiki.com/).

This Chrome extension is designed to ease these problems.
