# PubConnector


**PubConnector** is a Chrome extension designed to streamline research by linking publications from multiple platforms. With PubConnector, you can view publications in [Zotero](https://www.zotero.org) and [TiddlyWiki](https://tiddlywiki.com) directly from your web browser.  

## Motivation  

I have been using [Zotero](https://www.zotero.org/) and [Refnotes](https://kookma.github.io/TW-Refnotes/) in [TiddlyWiki](https://tiddlywiki.com/) to manage my references. However, when searching for and reading new literature online, I often encounter the following challenges:  

- **Keeping track of existing literature**: It's not always easy to remember which references are already stored in [Zotero](https://www.zotero.org/) and [TiddlyWiki](https://tiddlywiki.com/).  
- **Cross-platform searching**: Searching for the same literature across platforms like [Scopus](https://www.scopus.com/) and [Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.com/) can be tedious.  
- **Linking back to TiddlyWiki**: Navigating back to specific notes or tiddlers in [TiddlyWiki](https://tiddlywiki.com/) is not always straightforward.  

This Chrome extension is designed to address these issues, streamlining the research process and improving efficiency.  

## Features:  
- Access your [Zotero](https://www.zotero.org) items and open associated PDF files.  
- Navigate to specific [TiddlyWiki](https://tiddlywiki.com) tiddlers for organized research notes.  
- Link to scholarly resources, including [Scopus](https://www.scopus.com), [Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.com), publishers, and more.  

## Prerequisites  

Before using **PubConnector**, ensure that your TiddlyWiki and Zotero are properly configured to support integration with the extension. 

### TiddlyWiki  

1. **Run TiddlyWiki in Node.js Mode**:  
   - **PubConnector** uses the TiddlyWiki [WebAPI](https://tiddlywiki.com/static/WebServer%2520API.html) to access publications stored in TiddlyWiki.  
   - Install [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) if it is not already installed.  
   - Set up TiddlyWiki in Node.js mode by following the [official guide](https://tiddlywiki.com/#Installing%20TiddlyWiki%20on%20Node.js).  

2. **Enable CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing)**:  
   - Use a proxy server like [NGINX](https://nginx.org/) or configure TiddlyWiki directly to accept requests from the browser by adding the appropriate CORS headers.  

3. **Install the TW-Connector Plugin**:  
   - Install the [TW-Connector](https://github.com/byzheng/TW-Connector) plugin, a small TiddlyWiki extension that allows opening tiddlers from other tabs in the web browser.  
   - Follow the instructions provided in the [TW-Connector repository](https://github.com/byzheng/TW-Connector) to install the plugin.  

4. **Data Structure**  
   **PubConnector** utilizes information stored in TiddlyWiki to render on web pages:

   - Tiddlers with the tag `Colleague` are used for researcher information, including fields like `scopus`, `orcid`, and `google-scholar` for profile links on [Scopus](https://www.scopus.com), [ORCID](https://orcid.org/), and [Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.com).
   
   - Tiddlers with the tag `bibtex-entry` (imported via [Refnotes](https://kookma.github.io/TW-Refnotes/)) are used for publications, including fields like:  
     - `scopus-eid` for the Scopus identifier,  
     - `scholar-cid` and `scholar-cites` for the Google Scholar identifier (which might not always be accurate).  
     
     These fields can be programmatically retrieved using [R scripts](https://github.com/byzheng/RPubConnector).

### Zotero  

1. **Enable Third-Party API Access**:  
   - Open Zotero and go to **Settings > Advanced.  
   - Enable `Allow other application on this computer to communicate with Zotero`.  

After completing these prerequisites, **PubConnector** will be ready to link your references across TiddlyWiki, Zotero, and other platforms.
