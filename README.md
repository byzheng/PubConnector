# PubConnector


**PubConnector** is a Chrome extension designed to streamline research by linking publications from multiple platforms. With PubConnector, you can manage publications in [Zotero](https://www.zotero.org) and [TiddlyWiki](https://tiddlywiki.com) directly from your web browser.  

## Features:  
- Access your [Zotero](https://www.zotero.org) items and open associated PDF files.  
- Navigate to specific [TiddlyWiki](https://tiddlywiki.com) tiddlers for organized research notes.  
- Link to scholarly resources, including [Scopus](https://www.scopus.com), [Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.com), publishers, and more.  

## Motivation  

I have been using [Zotero](https://www.zotero.org/) and [Refnotes](https://kookma.github.io/TW-Refnotes/) in [TiddlyWiki](https://tiddlywiki.com/) to manage my references. However, when searching for and reading new literature online, I often encounter the following challenges:  

- **Keeping track of existing literature**: It's not always easy to remember which references are already stored in [Zotero](https://www.zotero.org/) and [TiddlyWiki](https://tiddlywiki.com/).  
- **Cross-platform searching**: Searching for the same literature across platforms like [Scopus](https://www.scopus.com/) and [Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.com/) can be tedious.  
- **Linking back to TiddlyWiki**: Navigating back to specific notes or tiddlers in [TiddlyWiki](https://tiddlywiki.com/) is not always straightforward.  

This Chrome extension is designed to address these issues, streamlining the research process and improving efficiency.
